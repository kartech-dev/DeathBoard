# ♟️ Chesh — A Bloody Twist on Chess  

Chesh is a chess variant with a brutal new rule:  
whenever a piece is captured, it bleeds onto the board, filling a **blood bar** for that team.  
The catch? **If your blood bar reaches 70%, you lose** — even if you’re winning on the board.  

Forget checkmate. In Chesh, every kill brings you closer to death.
